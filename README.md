# Perceptron Algorithm for Binary Classification

## By: Sahil Sewani

This Python script implements a basic Perceptron algorithm for binary classification using a dataset related to cars and SUVs. It contains functionalities for training the Perceptron, visualizing the dataset, plotting the decision boundary, and computing the error rate surface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## Usage

1. **Dataset**: Ensure the `carSUV_normalized.csv` dataset file is in the same directory.
2. **Run the Script**: Execute the `perceptron_classification.py` file using Python.
    ```bash
    python Perceptron_Raw_Code.py.py
    ```

## Description

- `Perceptron_Raw_Code.py`: Main script containing the Perceptron implementation.
- `carSUV_normalized.csv`: Dataset containing information related to cars and SUVs (normalized).
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the code and its usage.
- `Perceptron.ipynb`: Contains example code usage and output.

## Implementation Details

- Reads the dataset and converts it into NumPy arrays.
- Trains the Perceptron algorithm for binary classification of cars and SUVs based on features (ZeroToSixty and PowerHP).
- Plots the dataset, visualizing cars in green and SUVs in red.
- Computes and plots the decision boundary line derived from the learned weights.
- Generates a 3D surface plot depicting the error rates across different weight combinations.
